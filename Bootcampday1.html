<title> D and C's Coding bootcamp day 1 </title>
</head>
<body>
<h3> Morning Session </h3> <p> Together with many other new STEM girls, we found it quite difficult navigating our way to the bootcamp venue. We arrived later than agreed commencement time but technically were not late as every one who was already present still stood outside. <br> In no time, however, camp doors opened and Israel declared the camp officially open. </p>
<p> We basically relaxed some by getting to know bits about one another with some girls wowing with their proposed camp goals. There were other elements like an interactive introduction to the internet which, for me, was enlightening; Web and internet don't mean the same thing, for instance - the later is the broader term, and a server is literally a physical system.
<br> We also learnt the STEM chant and song. Oh and did I mention we got to meet Wonder woman and Super girl?. They're pretty cool. <br> <a href="dnc.html"> click for a glimpse of our first day's didactics. </a></p>
